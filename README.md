# GodotDart

An attempt to be able to use Dart as a scripting language for Godot.

Because I like Dart.

And I want to use it in Godot.

# Using

Uh.. don't yet.

# More Info

The `bindings_generator` tool will generate Dart classes for interacting with Godot. This tool currently only generates built-ins, some of which may be implemented in pure Dart do avoid going back and forth to Godot to do things like Vector, Quaternion, AABB, and other math operations.

This utilizes my custom built Dart shared library for embedding Dart, the source for which is available [here](https://github.com/fuzzybinary/dart_shared_libray). I've included the win64 prebuilt binaries in this repo for simplicity.
